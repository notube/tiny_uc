This is a first attempt at an html / js / ruby tiny UC implementation. It's buggy, crufty and 
incomplete. It doesn't play video. The zerconf part only works if you incorprate it into a phonegap 
app. It depends on XMPP for 'tv'-server communication. You need access to an XMPP server that does 
MUC.

To get it working:

* sudo gem install xmpp4r dnssd
* cd server
* open server.rb and add credential information (jabber server, username, password, muc room id)
* ruby server.rb
* open basicclient.html in a browser
* edit tinyplayer for the muc room id you used for the server
* open tinyplayer.html in a browser
* click on stuff
